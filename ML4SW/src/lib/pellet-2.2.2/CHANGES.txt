            missing OWLAPI 3.0 support.

            or more OWL ontologies relevant properties, metadata, and
            other information, including OWL2 profile detection.

* FIXED: Lots of bugs; see the 2.1 release report in Trac for a
         complete listing:

Pellet 2.0-rc1 (Oct 27, 2008)
-----------------------------

* MODIFIED: Licensing terms changed

     Pellet is now available under dual licensing whereby use of Pellet 
     in projects that are licensed so as to be compatible with AGPL 
     Version 3 may use Pellet under the terms of that license. However, 
     if AGPL Version 3.0 terms are incompatible with your use of 
     Pellet, compatible or alternative license terms are available from          
     Clark & Parsia LLC. See LICENSE.txt in the distribution for more
     details on licensing conditions.

* ADDED: OWL2 support

     OWL 1.1 support in Pellet has now been updated to support OWL2 as
     described in the latest W3C working draft [1]. Reasoning support
     for the new OWL2 constructs has been improved and more robustly
     tested.
         
     [1] http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/WD-owl2-syntax-20081008/
 
* ADDED: Optimized OWL2-EL classifier

     A classifier specifically optimized for the OWL2-EL profile [2] 
     has been added. Pellet will automatically detect if an ontology
     fits into OWL2-EL expressivity and use the optimized classifier.
     The OWL2-EL classifier provide both better speed and improved
     memory usage for the classification task. It has been tested to
     classify ontologies with half a billion classes on a commodity
     laptop.  
     
     [2] http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/WD-owl2-profiles-20081008/#OWL_2_EL

* ADDED: Module extractor

     An ontology module extractor has been added. Given a set of terms
     from an input ontology, module extractor will extract a subset of 
     the ontology that is relevant for those terms. Locality-based 
     modularity notion is used to ensure the logical completeness of
     the extracted module. The extracted module from a large ontology
     will typically be much smaller making it easier to understand
     (for humans) and process (for tools).  

* ADDED: Incremental classifier

     A new classifier implementation that can update classification
     results upon ontology changes has been added. Incremental 
     classifier uses Pellet to compute the initial class hierarchy but
     when the ontology is updated (through addition or removal of 
     axioms) only relevant parts are recomputed. Relevant parts of the
     class hierarchy are found using the modules automatically 
     extracted.

* ADDED: SPARQL-DL support

     A new query engine that can answer SPARQL-DL queries has been 
     added. This engine can answer mixed ABox/TBox queries and 
     supports special query predicates, e.g. a special predicate to
     retrieve direct subclasses. SPARQL-DL engine is also integrated
     into the Jena ARQ engine such that ARQ handles the SPARQL algebra
     for complex constructs like OPTIONAL, UNION, FILTEE and SPARQL-DL
     engine answers Basic Graph Patterns (BGP). This coupling provides
     the most efficient query evaluation strategy.

* ENHANCED: SWRL support

     Reasoning performance for DL-safe SWRL rules have been improved 
     significantly. Rule support in Pellet now covers all the built-in
     functions from the SWRL specification [3] with the exception of
     rdf:List related functions. 

     [3] http://www.w3.org/Submission/SWRL/#8
     
* ENHANCED: Explanation generation

     The explanation generation functionality has been improved to
     retrieve multiple explanations for an inference. The support has
     been extended to cover all of the OWL2 vocabulary. There are new
     convenience classes that makes it easy to compute explanations
     along with pretty printers for generated explanations. 

* ADDED: Pellint integration

     Pellint [4], the ontology lint tool, is integrated to the Pellet 
     distribution and can be run directly from the Pellet command line
     interface. Pellint provides lint functionality both at the RDF 
     level, e.g. reporting untyped RDF resources, and OWL level, e.g.
     reporting suspicious OWL axioms. Pellint detects modeling styles
     in OWL ontologies that degrades the reasoner performance. 
     
     [4] http://pellet.owldl.com/pellint

* ENHANCED: Fine-grained inference extraction

     Pellet now provides a highly customizable inference extractor 
     that can be used to export inferences from the reasoner quickly.
     Extractor can be configured to select what kind of inferences, 
     e.g. subclass inferences vs. disjoint class inferences, should be
     extracted giving users more control over the extraction process.

* ENHANCED: Command line interface (CLI)

	 Pellet CLI has been completely redesigned to provide easy access
	 to all the existing and new features of Pellet. There is one 
	 uniform GNU-style interface that can be used for consistency
	 checking, classification, realization, querying, entailment 
	 checking, inference extraction, explanation, and extraction of
	 modules.     
	
* ADDED: Compute transitivity hierarchy

     A new class is introduced to display hierarchies defined in an
     ontology. In addition to the standard subclass hierarchy many
     ontologies define additional hierarchies, partinomy hierarchy
     being the most common one. The hierarchies are defined via a
     transitive property and can be at the class level, e.g. Gene
     ontology uses someValuesFrom restrictions in class descriptions, 
     or at the instance level, e.g. SKOS ontologies use properties 
     like 'broader' and 'narrower' in property assertions. Pellet now
     provides support to compute these hierarchies both through API
     calls and command line interface.   
     
* ENHANCED: Reasoning performance

     Consistency checking, the main reasoning service used by all the
     other reasoning services, has been improved to be more efficient.
     The improvements are especially significant for ontologies with
     a large number of instances. For example, consistency checking 
     time for LUBM dataset is reduced by an order of magnitude.
     
* ENHANCED: Memory usage

     The internal Pellet structures have been improved significantly
     to reduce the memory requirements. These changes improve the 
     memory usage for both ABox and TBox reasoning. For LUBM dataset
     which is ABox-heavy, the memory reduction was three-fold. For NCI
     Thesuarus which is TBox-heavy, the memory reduction is two-fold.

* ADDED: Annotation support

     Pellet now provides native support for storing and querying OWL 
     annotations. Even though annotations do not have semantic effect
     they are very commonly used in queries, e.g. retrieve the label
     for a class or an individual. Pellet SPARQL-DL engine can handle
     annotation properties directly reducing the need to fall-back to
     the Jena query engine.
     
* ENHANCED: Interrupting reasoning process with user-defined timeouts

     Pellet timer API and its internal use has been updated to allow
     users interrupt the reasoning process with user-defined timeouts.
     Users can define a timeout for basic reasoning services like
     consistency checking, classification, or realization and Pellet
     will stop the reasoning process when the amount of time specified 
     has elapsed.      
     
* REMOVED: Species validator

     OWL species validation functionality that was used to report the
     OWL species (Lite, DL, Full) has been removed. The species 
     validator was very much outdated and was about to become obsolete
     as the OWL2 specification becomes a W3C recommendation. OWL2 spec
     defines three "profiles" and discontinues the use original OWL 
     species definitions. We are planning to provide functionality to 
     detect and report OWL2 profiles in the future. The most commonly 
     used feature of the species validator was to find and fix untyped
     resources in RDF documents which is still provided in Pellet with 
     the 'lint' subcommand.

* FIXED: Various bugs
