SWMLAlgorithms
==============

Various implementation of machine learning algorithms for Semantic Web knowledge bases 

The software provides the implementation of the algorithms for inducing:
- Terminological Decision Trees
- Terminological Random Forests 
- Evidential Terminological Decision Trees and Forests
- kernelized perceptron 
- k-nearest neighbor

in order to assess the class-membership of OWL individuals
